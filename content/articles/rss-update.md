Title: RSS/Atom feeds update
Category: Blog
Tags: pelican, rss
Slug: rss-feed-update

Dear reader,

If you are following this blog via RSS/Atom feeds, you have probably noticed that
all the articles of this one have been marked as unread in your RSS reader. This is
due to an small technical change in the URL's of the articles.

Please also note that I have added [several feeds](http://roidelapluie.be/feeds/) for tags and categories.

An interresting feed is probably the [planet-inuits](http://roidelapluie.be/feeds/planet-inuits.tag.atom.xml) feed, which contains the articles I publish on the [inuits planet](https://inuits.eu/blog/).

My apologies for that.
