Title: CSS update
Category: Blog
Tags: pelican, css
Slug: css-update

As the [YAML CSS](https://yaml.de) project looks like dead, I have changed the
design of my blog to [Primer](https://primercss.io), the CSS Framework made by
GitHub.

I hope that you will enjoy it, it should be more readable and easy to navigate. Everything should have been ported to that new design. I have removed openpgp.js because it was not used.

As a reminder I have a RSS feed that contains only my technical articles: the [planet-inuits](http://roidelapluie.be/feeds/planet-inuits.tag.atom.xml) tag feed..
