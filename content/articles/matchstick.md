I have backed [Matchstick](https://matchstick.tv), the HDMI stick based on [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/os/).

There are a few reasons why I have chosen to do so.

The first reason is the open-source part of that project. An open-source software
combined with open-source hardware, that is everything I like. Good philisophy is always a good point.

Next that project is exciting. An easy to use HDMI stick for my TV is something really cool. I do
not have a "smart" TV but still my TV has some HDMI input and USB plugs (to power the stick).

Third part: it is cheap. It worth its 18 USD. If you see the opponents, it is a cheap but solid alternative.
Price really matters and I even find that the announced market price (25 USD) is acceptable.

Also I am really happy to see an new device that IS NOT run by Android. Android is
too mainstream I think, and even if it is open-source, the Google-way of managing it
is not something I like.

Now we will see what we will get at the end, if the promises will be fullfilled and how will the stick
behave in real conditions. I also hope that a lot of the apps ecosystem will also be open-source.
